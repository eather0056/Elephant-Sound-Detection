 kaiserord FIR order estimator (lowpass, highpass, bandpass, multiband).
    [N,Wn,BTA,FILTYPE] = kaiserord(F,A,DEV,Fs) is the approximate order N,
    normalized frequency band edges Wn, Kaiser window beta parameter BTA
    and filter type FILTYPE to be used by the FIR1 function:
       B = FIR1(N, Wn, FILTYPE, kaiser( N+1,BTA ), 'noscale' )
 
    The resulting filter will approximately meet the specifications given
    by the input parameters F, A, and DEV.
 
    F is a vector of band edge frequencies in Hz, in ascending order
    between 0 and half the sampling frequency Fs.  A is a vector of 0s and
    1s specifying the desired function's amplitude on the bands defined by
    F. The length of F is twice the length of A, minus 2 (it must therefore
    be even).  The first frequency band is assumed to start at zero, and
    the last one always ends at Fs/2.
 
    DEV is a vector of maximum deviations or ripples (in linear units)
    allowable for each band. The smallest deviation specified (MIN(DEV)) is
    used for both the passband and the stopband.
 
    Fs is the sampling frequency (which defaults to 2 if you leave it off).
 
    C = kaiserord(F,A,DEV,Fs,'cell') is a cell-array whose elements are the
    parameters to FIR1.
 
  % EXAMPLE
  %     Design a lowpass filter with a passband edge of 1500Hz, a
  %     stopband edge of 2000Hz, passband ripple of 0.01, stopband ripple
  %     of 0.1, and a sampling frequency of 8000Hz:
 
       [n,Wn,bta,filtype] = kaiserord( [1500 2000], [1 0], [0.01 0.1], 8000 );
       b = fir1(n, Wn, filtype, kaiser(n+1,bta), 'noscale');
 
  %     This is equivalent to
       c = kaiserord( [1500 2000], [1 0], [0.01 0.1], 8000, 'cell' );
       b = fir1(c{:});
 
  %  CAUTION 1: The order N is just an estimate. If the filter does not
  %  meet the original specifications, a higher order such as N+1, N+2, etc.
  %  will; if the filter exceeds the specs, a slightly lower order one may work.
  %  CAUTION 2: Results are inaccurate if cutoff frequencies are near zero
  %  frequency or the Nyquist frequency; or if the devs are large (10%).
