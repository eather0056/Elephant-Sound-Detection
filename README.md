Bhuiyan, "A Warning and Detection System for Elephant Intrusions utilizing Signal Processing and IoT," 2022 4th International Conference on Electrical, Computer & Telecommunication Engineering (ICECTE), Rajshahi, Bangladesh, 2022, pp. 1-4, doi: 10.1109/ICECTE57896.2022.10114507.Abstract: Elephant incursions have become more prevalent in rural regions, with herds of wild elephants crashing into human dwellings and causing significant property and life damage. This study presents a combined method for spotting elephants using sound and footstep vibrations. Using this technology, elephant horn and footstep vibrations will be detected. The project's outcomes can be viewed on ThingSpeak. This IoT server was utilized to store publicly accessible data for the mobile app. After successfully filtering and detecting sounds within the MATLAB model, graphical representations of the Input Sound, Elephant Sound, Background Sound, Input Vibration, Elephant Vibration, and Elephant Detection have been created.
